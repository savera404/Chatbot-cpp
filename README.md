# Chatbot-cpp
I created a chatbot using Qt in C++ language. 
It does not contain any AI or ML aspects.
Contains if-else conditions.
It is a social engagement chatbot.
It contains jokes, and rock, paper, scissors game.
Contains API for computer and tech-related quiz questions (API to Open Trivia DB: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The user will ask the chatbot to give them questions and the chatbot will fetch questions from this API database. 
Contains a UI designed in Qt.
